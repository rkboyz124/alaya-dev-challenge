# Alaya mern dev challenge 

MERN is a scaffolding tool which makes it easy to build isomorphic apps using Mongo, Express, React and NodeJS. It minimises the setup time and gets you up to speed using proven technologies.

**Note : Please make sure your MongoDB is running.** For MongoDB installation guide see [this](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/installation/). Also `npm6` is required to install dependencies properly.

## Quickstart

```sh
  npm install
  npm start
```

### ES6 support
We use babel to transpile code in both server and client with `stage-0` plugin. So, you can use both ES6 and experimental ES7 features.


## Show us your skills :)

In this project (*which is just a [mern-starter](http://mern.io/documentation.html)*) you can write and edit post blog.

To show us your skills we would like you to build at least one of theses 2 features:

### 1 - Add geolocation to post creation and display it on post element (Full-stack)

The purpose is to be able to attach a geolocation by entering an address in the `PostCreatWidget`,
 to persit it in the `post.js` mongoose model and then to display it using the `PostListItem.js`

For the geocoding you can use the api you want (like [nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) for [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/46.449/2.210) 
or [google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)).

It would be perfect if we can store at least one gps location and one address in database by post.

You can maybe use the [MongoDB geospatial api](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/) to format your data

### 2 - Add a markdown rich text editor to post creation (Front-end)

You can write markdown manually when creating a post.

To render markdown content we use `ReactMarkdown` in the `PostListItem`.

The purpose here is to have a wysiwyg rich text editor component with a material-ui style doing this stuff when creating a post.

You can use any npm package you want (like [slatejs](https://www.slatejs.org/#/rich-text) or maybe [react-mde](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde))

Good luck :)
